# Ellipse-Calculator
A Java program which takes input for h, k, a, and b values of an ellipse. It then calculates and prints out the equation of the ellipse as well as all details such as the major and minor axes, coordinates of the foci and center, whether it is a vertical or horizontal ellipse, etc.

This project is mostly complete, but some minor improvements can be made to make it more sophiscated.
